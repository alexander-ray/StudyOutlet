# StudyOutlet
## Vision Statement
StudyOutlet provides an organized testing framework to help students review.
## About
StudyOutlet is an iOS app that provides randomized practice tests for any given subject and topic. The scope of this project is, at the moment, limited to Physics GRE practice tests. Practice tests are generated by pulling a certain number of randomized questions from the database each time a user wants to take a test. The length and number of questions for a given practice test are customizable.
## To Do
### Backend
* Figure out how to alter session characteristics (time, etc)
* Add expiration to access tokens
* Add model for incorrect questions, along with basic routes
* Add any other user attributes we think we need
### Frontend
* Apply layout constraints to app to reduce sizing inconsistancies
