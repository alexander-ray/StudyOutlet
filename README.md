# StudyOutlet
## Vision Statement
StudyOutlet provides an organized testing framework to help students review.
## About
StudyOutlet is an iOS app that provides randomized practice tests for any given subject and topic. The scope of this project is, at the moment, limited to Physics GRE practice tests. Practice tests are generated by pulling a certain number of randomized questions from the database each time a user wants to take a test. The length and number of questions for a given practice test are customizable. The user will be allowed to try any one question as many times as they need to get it correct, and will recieve the number of questions they got right on their FIRST TRY at the end of the test. We plan on implementating an incorrect questions database so a user can quickly go back and review their week points. We also will later put in a review by fields function, to make a practice test more specific.
## To Do
### Backend
* Add expiration to access tokens
* Add model for incorrect questions, along with basic routes
### Frontend
* Apply layout constraints to app to reduce sizing inconsistancies
